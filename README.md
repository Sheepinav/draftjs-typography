# Draft.js Rich Text Editor with some built in typography based on Microsoft Word
Barebones text editor with added typography and search and replace functionality.
Pulled and edited from a larger project where it was used extensively. 

## How it works
Creates a new child component of RichTextEditor in Textbox.js and manages state in the parent (Textbox) container.
Further styling and features may be included in the future.
